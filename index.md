Hi! I'm a fourth year Ph. D. student at the [Department of Statistical Science, Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/), working under the supervision of [David Dunson](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dunson).

# About Me

Before starting my Ph. D. at Duke, I completed my Bachelors and Masters degrees in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](www.isical.ac.in), with a specialization in Theoretical Statistics. I became fascinated with Bayesian Statistics after coming to know about [Lindley's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley%27s_paradox).
