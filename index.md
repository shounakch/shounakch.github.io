Hi! I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, working with [Dr. Marc A. Suchard](https://suchard-group.github.io/).

# About Me

Before UCLA, I completed my Ph. D. at the Department of Statistical Sciene, Duke University, under the supervision of [Dr. David B. Dunson](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dunson). I completed my Bachelors and Masters degrees in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/). I became fascinated with Bayesian Statistics after coming to know about [Lindley's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley%27s_paradox). 

I'm from the ever-lively city of Kolkata, India, famous for its [food](https://www.eater.com/23506205/best-places-to-eat-restaurants-travel-2023) among other things!
