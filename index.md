Prior to joining UVA, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, working with [Dr. Marc A. Suchard](https://suchard-group.github.io/). I completed my Ph.

Before Duke, I completed my Bachelors and Masters degrees in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).
