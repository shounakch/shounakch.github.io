I'm broadly interested in developing scalable and structured Bayesian methodology. I'm excited by the prospect of being able to build interpretable, scalable models which exploit underlying information in a specific problem. Currently, I'm interested in fast computation of credible sets in the setting of Bayesian nonparametric function estimation. Can we incorporate shape constraints on a function to build a credible set under a given model? I'm also interested in modeling interactions between agents in epidemiological settings and between drug combinations in medicine.
