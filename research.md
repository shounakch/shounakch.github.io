I am interested in developing scalable and structured Bayesian methods which are interpretable. Such methods require building probabilistic models relying on incorporating available prior knowledge about the specific problem. In particular, I am intrigued by shape constrained function estimation, latent factor models, and nonparametric Bayesian methods. I am also interested in large-scale observational data driven inferences regarding matters of public health.

<!--- Earlier, I had 

1. Collaborated with [Dr. Antik Chakraborty](https://antik015.github.io/) in developing [**Nearest Neighbor Dirichlet Mixtures**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07953), a scalable method for density estimation as an alternative to traditional Bayesian density estimators such as the [Dirichlet process mixture model](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ywteh/research/npbayes/dp.pdf). 
2. Developed [**Synergistic Antagonistic Interaction Detection**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09279), an interpretable and efficient method for detection of synergistic and antagonistic interactions between chemical exposures in epidemiological data, in collaboration with [Dr. Stephanie M. Engel](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/stephanie-m-engel-phd/). --->
