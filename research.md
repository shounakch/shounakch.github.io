I am interested in developing scalable and structured Bayesian methods which are interpretable. Such methods require building probabilistic models relying on incorporating available prior knowledge about the specific problem. In particular, I am intrigued by shape constrained function estimation, latent factor models, and density estimation. I am also interested in assessing the impact of environmental exposures on human health from epidemiological data. 

Recently, I have been collaborating with [Wesley Tansey](http://wesleytansey.com/) to think about modeling drug combinations in high-throughput cancer data, which can be complex and computationally challenging. 

Earlier, I had collaborated with [Antik Chakraborty](https://antik015.github.io/) in developing [**Nearest Neighbor Dirichlet Mixtures**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07953), a scalable method for density estimation as an alternative to traditional Bayesian density estimators such as the [Dirichlet process mixture model](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ywteh/research/npbayes/dp.pdf).
