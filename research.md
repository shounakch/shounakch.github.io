I'm interested in developing scalable and structured Bayesian methods which are interpretable. Such methods require building probabilistic models often utilizing available information on specific aspects of the relevant problem. In particular, I'm intrigued by shape constrained function estimation, latent factor models, and density estimation. I'm also interested in assessing the impact of environmental exposures on human health from epidemiological data. 

Recently, I have been collaborating with [Wesley Tansey](http://wesleytansey.com/) to think about modeling drug combinations in high-throughput cancer data, which can be complex and computationally challenging. 

Earlier, I had collaborated with [Antik Chakraborty](https://antik015.github.io/) in developing a scalable method for density estimation as an alternative to traditional Bayesian density estimators such as the [Dirichlet process mixture model](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ywteh/research/npbayes/dp.pdf).
