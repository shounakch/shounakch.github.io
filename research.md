I am interested in developing scalable, structured, and interpretable Bayesian methods, with a focus on Bayesian nonparametrics. These often involve building probabilistic models, with particular interests being: 

(1) incorporating prior information relevant to a specific problem of interest, 

(2) bypassing existing computational bottlenecks, and 

(3) obtaining provable theoretical guarantees. 

As a part of the global [OHDSI](https://ohdsi.org/) community, I am passionate about delivering reliable clinical evidence from massive observational healthcare data-driven studies.

<!--- Earlier, I had 

1. Collaborated with [Dr. Antik Chakraborty](https://antik015.github.io/) in developing [**Nearest Neighbor Dirichlet Mixtures**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07953), a scalable method for density estimation as an alternative to traditional Bayesian density estimators such as the [Dirichlet process mixture model](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ywteh/research/npbayes/dp.pdf). 
2. Developed [**Synergistic Antagonistic Interaction Detection**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09279), an interpretable and efficient method for detection of synergistic and antagonistic interactions between chemical exposures in epidemiological data, in collaboration with [Dr. Stephanie M. Engel](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/stephanie-m-engel-phd/). --->
